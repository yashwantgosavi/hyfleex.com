                The best german class in Nashik with proper guidance and
                Ms.Rutuja takes in a lot of effort to teach. Each and every
                concept is explained by her in detail without any hesitation.
                And there is a lot of interaction with the other students which
                helps to boost confidence. Would highly recommend.

                I have completed my A1 course. It has been a fun learning ride.
                The concepts were eased into us with the help of many
                interactive activities, games and worksheet. Maam has been
                really good with her knowledge and efforts.I would highly
                recommend you if u really wanna learn German.

                Rutuja mam is great teacher who ensures that all her students
                learn the language. She covers all the factors of the language
                like reading, speaking, writing and listening. Actually german
                grammar is difficult but she breaks it down so easily and makes
                it comprehensible. I highly recommend that you can start your
                journey with Rutuja mam.

                With the quench for learning a foreign language, I started
                learning German Online at Hyflex Education. The teaching was
                really convincing & interactive. Ma'am is interactive,
                approachable & focuses on learning. If anyone wants to learn a
                foreign language, I highly recommend Hyflex Education.

                The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and teaches
                meticulously. Her focus is on not only on grammer but also on
                improving communication skills. She is a great teacher indeed. I
                would really recommend joining her class.
